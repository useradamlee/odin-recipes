    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The cheeseburger! It's easily as American as apple pie. We love the simplicity of a basic cheeseburger from the grill, of course. But sometimes we want to gild the lily a little. And these cheeseburger recipes add a little something extra — a spicy sauce, some over-the-top toppings, a secret stuffing — because, sometimes, more of a good thing is just the right amount!
